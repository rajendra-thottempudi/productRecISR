    <p>Let R<sub>cp</sub>, R<sub>cv</sub> and R<sub>like</sub> be binary relationships where, aR<sub>cp</sub>b represents that a is co-purchased with b, aR<sub>cv</sub>b represents that a is coviewed with b, and aR<sub>like</sub>b represents that a is similar to b based on its product features.</p>

	<p>Consider a sample product graph in Figure 1, where a node corresponds to a product and an edge corresponds to a co-purchase or co-view relationship between the products.RPR problem entails few challenges which we illustrate using Figure 1 as follows:
		<ul>
			<li>product relevance: Given a query product P, we would like to suggest related products such as an adapter AC, phone case PC, AirPods AP, screen guard SC</li>
			<li>product asymmetry: For a phone P, we would like to recommend a suitable phone case PC, but for a phone case PC, it may not be apt to recommend a phone P because customers typically would purchase a phone case only while owning a phone. Formally, product asymmetry can be represented as \[aR_{cp}b \not \Rightarrow bR_{cp}a\]</li>
			<li>selection bias: It is inherent to historical purchase data due to several factors like product availability, price etc. For example, while shopping for a phone case for phone P, customer c<sub>1</sub> might browse phone cases PC and PC1 (PC2 and PC3 are not shown to him owing to some of the factors mentioned above). Another customer c<sub>2</sub> might browse phone cases PC and PC2 (PC1 and PC3 are not presented to him). A third customer c<sub>3</sub> might browse phone cases PC and PC3 (PC1 and PC2 are not presented to him). Assume that all three customers eventually purchase PC; this could also be due to a bias in the list of products shown to each customer. In our example, across different customers, PC, PC1, PC2 and PC3 are co-viewed (similar). In order to correct for selection bias, we would like to recommend not only phone case PC, but also PC1, PC2 and PC3 as related products given a query product P. Formally, we want to uncover relationships of the form:
					\[aR_{cp}b \land bR_{cv}c \Rightarrow aR_{cp}c\]
					\[aR_{cv}b \land bR_{cp}c \Rightarrow aR_{cp}c\]
			</li>
			<li>cold-start product recommendations: We not only need to suggest recommendations for existing products, but also suggest recommendations for newly launched i.e. coldstart products. Formally, given two existing products a and b, and a cold-start product c, we want to uncover relationships of the form:
					\[cR_{like}a \land aR_{cp}b \Rightarrow cR_{cp}b\]
					\[aR_{cp}b \land bR_{like}c \Rightarrow aR_{cp}c\]
			</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>These rules correspond to the case when c is the query product and the recommended product respectively. Observe that mitigating selection bias and tackling cold-start products deal with modelling transitive relationships, while preserving edge asymmetry.</p>

			<h2> Motivation </h2>
			<p> The motivation behind building a recommendation system on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the e-commerce space is the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of product recommendations. GNNs are able to capture complex relationships between users and items in a graph structure, which can provide more meaningful and personalized recommendations compared to traditional collaborative filtering methods. Additionally, GNN-based recommendation systems have the ability to handle large-scale and dynamic data, making them suitable for the constantly evolving e-commerce landscape. Overall, the use of GNNs in recommendation systems has the potential to enhance the shopping experience for users and increase sales for e-commerce businesses.

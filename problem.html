			<h2> Motivation </h2>
			<p> The motivation behind building a recommendation system on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for the e-commerce space is the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of product recommendations. GNNs are able to capture complex relationships between users and items in a graph structure, which can provide more meaningful and personalized recommendations compared to traditional collaborative filtering methods. Additionally, GNN-based recommendation systems have the ability to handle large-scale and dynamic data, making them suitable for the constantly evolving e-commerce landscape. Overall, the use of GNNs in recommendation systems has the potential to enhance the shopping experience for users and increase sales for e-commerce businesses.
			</p>
			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>We deal with the problem of recommending related products i.e., given a query product, we would like to suggest top-k products that have high likelihood to be bought together with it.
			</p>
			<h2> Challenges </h2>
			<p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>Our problem implicitly assumes asymmetry i.e., for a phone, we would like to recommend a suitable phone case, but for a phone case, it may not be apt to recommend a phone because customers typically would purchase a phone case only while owning a phone</p></li>
				<li><p>We also do not limit ourselves to complementary or substitute product recommendation. For example, for a specific night wear t-shirt, we can suggest similar t-shirts as well as track pants. So, the notion of relatedness is subjective to the query product and dependent on customer preferences.</p></li>
				<li><p> Further, various factors such as product price, availability lead to presence of selection bias in the historical purchase data, that needs to be controlled for while training related product recommendations model</p></li>
				<li>All these challenges are orthogonal to each other deeming our problem nontrivial</li>
			</ul>
			</p>
			<h2> Solution </h2>
			<p> We had developed, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) based framework for related product recommendation, wherein the problem is formulated as a node recommendation task on a directed product graph. In order to capture product asymmetry, we employ an asymmetric loss function and learn dual embeddings for each product, by appropriately aggregating features from its neighborhood
